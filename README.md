Overview of Data

This dataset was gathered from the StockX 2019 Data contest where they provided us with shoe sales data. The dataset consists of a random sample of all Off-White x Nike and Yeezy 350 sales from between 9/1/2017  and 2/14/2019(the month that Off-White first debuted “The Ten” collection). There are 99,956 total sales in the data set; 27,794 Off-White sales, and 72,162 Yeezy sales. The sample consists of U.S. sales only.

Business Problem

•	What shoes are most popular?
•	Which shoes have the best/worst profit margins?
•	What factors affect profit margin?
•	Is it possible to predict the sale price of a shoe at a given time? (i.e. when should I sell?)
